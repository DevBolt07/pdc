        <p>
          We, the Members of Personality Development Club, work to develop our members' personalities 
          by focusing on all three aspects: <span class="highlight">Character</span>, 
          <span class="highlight">Competence</span>, and <span class="highlight">Culture</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We refer to authentic resources like books and scientific articles to understand and apply 
          physiological, philosophical, and cultural concepts.

          Our team is committed to working together, helping each other, growing as a group, and
